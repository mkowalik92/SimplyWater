# SimplyWater
-------------
+ 8/14 - Started from scratch again. Began by implementing simple skybox reflection on the top water plane. Made a decent depth shader and added transparency. Now I need to combine those effects to make something decent. Started working on refraction and will begin fresnel/edge foam soon since the depth texture is taken care of. 

### --- IN PROGRESS ---
+ Edge Foam
+ Refraction
+ Fresnel
+ Combining the effects
+ Puddles
